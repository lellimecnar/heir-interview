## Heir Interview

React part:
HEIR community is excited to talk to their favorite sports stars. We need to build a feature that would allow us to capture the questions and display them in the vertical list. Each question has username and question. If I press on the question, it should show the full question text. It should be possible to upvote and downvote questions. As an admin, I should be able to change the order of the questions. In the header, there should be a button ‘Start Chat’ to start the chat with the athlete that freezes the interactions with the list (you can’t reorder the questions anymore or react to them). We should also display the total number of questions that were submitted in the header next to the ‘Start Chat’ button.
